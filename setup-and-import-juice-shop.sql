- NPM package: `npm install -g juice-shop`

### Cloud Deployment
- Heroku: One-click deployment available
- AWS, Google Cloud, Azure: Docker container deployment
- Kubernetes: Use official Helm charts',

  '## Basic Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. **Find the Score Board**: This is your first challenge!
3. **Explore Vulnerabilities**: Browse the application and try to find security flaws
4. **Track Progress**: Check the score board to see solved challenges
5. **Use Hacking Instructor**: Enable tutorial mode for guided challenges

## Advanced Usage

### CTF Mode
Enable CTF flags for organized events:
```bash
set NODE_ENV=ctf
npm start
```

### Custom Configuration
Modify `config/default.yml` for:
- Custom branding
- Challenge difficulty
- Application behavior

### API Integration
- REST API available at `/api/`
- WebHook notifications

  'Juice Shop contains vulnerabilities spanning the entire OWASP Top 10 and beyond. Categories include:

- **Broken Access Control**: Admin sections, CSRF, basket manipulation
- **Broken Authentication**: Password reset flaws, 2FA bypass
- **Injection Flaws**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection
- **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak encryption, hash collisions
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Exposed endpoints, debug information
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Information disclosure, privacy violations

All vulnerabilities are intentionally designed for educational purposes.',

  '## Security Training Best Practices

1. **Controlled Environment**: Always run in isolated environment
2. **Educational Purpose**: Use only for legitimate security training
3. **No Production Use**: Never deploy on production networks
4. **Guided Learning**: Start with hacking instructor tutorials
5. **Progressive Difficulty**: Begin with easy challenges
6. **Document Learning**: Keep notes on discovered vulnerabilities

## Teaching Guidelines

- Explain vulnerability context before exploitation
- Demonstrate both attack and defense
- Reference OWASP cheat sheets for mitigation
- Encourage responsible disclosure practices',

  '## Common Issues

### Installation Problems
- **Node.js Version**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- **Memory Issues**: Increase heap size with `--max-old-space-size=4096`
- **Port Conflicts**: Change port with `PORT=8080 npm start`

### Challenge Issues
- **Score Board Not Found**: Look for patterns in URL structure
- **Challenges Not Unlocking**: Check browser console for hints
- **Progress Lost**: Enable local backup in settings

### Performance Issues
- **Slow Loading**: Clear browser cache and restart application
- **High CPU Usage**: Normal during vulnerability scanning
- **Docker Issues**: Ensure sufficient memory allocated',
